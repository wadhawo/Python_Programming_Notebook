This set determines the binary patterns the CPU can interpret and act upon, forming the foundation of all software execution. Common instruction sets include <b>x86 (16-bit), x86-32 (32-bit), x86-64 (AMD64), ARM,</b> and <b>RISC-V</b>, each tailored to different hardware platforms and performance goals. These sets define how the CPU handles operations like arithmetic, data movement, branching, and more.\n",

For example, <b>AVX 256-bit (Advanced Vector Extensions)</b> and <b>SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions)</b> enable parallel processing of data, which is crucial for multimedia, scientific computing, and machine learning workloads. These extensions allow the CPU to perform multiple operations simultaneously using vector registers, significantly speeding up computation.\n",

    "Popular word sizes used in microcomputers today are the <b>32-bit</b> and <b>64-bit</b>. A 32-bit CPU has a word size of 32 bits (4 bytes), meaning it can addressing up to 4GB of memory, while a 64-bit CPU has 64 bits allowing it to handle larger memory spaces and perform operations on wider data chunks.\n",

While the memory system stores data and instructions, it is the CPU—via its control unit, ALU, and registers—that interprets and executes these instructions using the defined ISA. The buses (address, data, and control) facilitate communication between the CPU and memory, but it is the instruction set that governs what the CPU can do with the data it receives.\n",
